;;; Commentary:
;;
;; blamee.el displays `git blame' information inline between the
;; display-line-numbers gutter and the source text.  Consecutive lines
;; sharing the same commit are grouped into a chunk; only the first line
;; of each chunk shows the blame prefix, the rest receive a blank
;; spacer of the same width so the source code stays aligned.
;;
;; The inline prefix defaults to a small date + author layout,
;; but its visible columns can be customized.  A per-commit background
;; color identifies chunk boundaries at a glance.  When point enters a
;; blamed line, a child-frame popup (or echo area on TTY) shows the
;; full commit detail: author, full timestamp, 12-char hash and
;; summary.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   (require 'blamee)
;;   (global-blamee-mode 1)   ; auto-enable in file buffers inside a git tree
;;
;;   M-x blamee-mode          ; toggle in a single buffer
;;
;; See README.md for installation recipes, customization and screenshots.
